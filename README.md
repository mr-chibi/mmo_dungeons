# What is Mr_Chibi'sMMO Dungeons?
Dungeons are an addon on to existing MMO pack, Mr_Chibi'sMMO! Allowing a diverse experience adding dungeons into game, to explore, loot and dodge traps with many more!!

## Do I need any pack requirements?
Yes, you'll need to download the main pack of "Mr_Chibi'sMMO" to play with this addon pack!

### Where Can I find the original pack?

### Does this use Minecrafts WorldGen?
No, this uses my own custom world generation system I coded into game. So players can have fun explore dungeon rooms without having them loading in full to give them way of having a fun! Without cheesing the dungeon getting a blind experience into something they've never seen before!

### Dungeons Spawning:
How do dungeon spawning work? It only works for "SPECIFIC" biomes meaning they're NOT going to spawn into biomes players would normally go into just way it's programmed.

### Dungeons Rooms:
* Some Rooms require players to acquire dungeon keys! From slaying certain amount of mobs in a dungeon room.
* Locked rooms require keys to progress.
* Entire dungeon doesn't spawn in just rooms as players progress! It will take full experience away if entire dungeon was spawned.
