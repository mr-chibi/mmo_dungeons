### How to get dungeon spawn eggs?
- Allow spawn egg avaliable is **by killing "Husks" in the "minecraft:desert" biome** it's 1-100 chance the egg will drop from a husk. Right click egg in desert anywhere and dungeon will appear. **Best recommendation** place it at a **low terrain feild in the desert**.

### Dungeons Spawning:
How do dungeon spawning work? It only works for "SPECIFIC" biomes meaning they're NOT going to spawn into biomes players would normally go into just way it's programmed.

### Dungeons Rooms:
* Some Rooms require players to acquire dungeon keys! From slaying certain amount of mobs in a dungeon room.
* Locked rooms require keys to progress.
* Entire dungeon doesn't spawn in just rooms as players progress! It will take full experience away if entire dungeon was spawned.
